        #   Without any `pin` lines, all workspaces default to output 0 except
        #   WS 10 which is auto-pinned to output 1 when a second monitor exists.
        #   Indices beyond output_count are clamped to output 0 so a `pin` line
        #   for an unplugged monitor still leaves the workspace reachable.
        #
        # pin 0 1                        # WS 10 → external (default)
        # pin 9 1                        # WS 9 also lives on external

        # === Window-to-workspace assignments ===
        # assign <class> <ws>
        #   New windows whose WM_CLASS class half matches <class> land on
        #   workspace <ws> (1..9, or 0 = WS 10) regardless of which workspace
        #   is currently focused. The window only becomes the active tab if
        #   <ws> is currently visible on its pinned output; otherwise it joins
        #   that workspace's tab strip and shows up in the bar's populated
        #   indicator. Up to 32 entries.
        #
        # Example (matches the i3 setup):
        # assign Weechat  1
        # assign discord  1
        # assign caprine  1
        # assign Kastrup  2
        # assign Tock     2
        # assign Firefox  3
        # assign firefox  3              # case-sensitive — list both for Mozilla
        # assign qutebrowser 3

        # === Stash-on-map ===
        # stash-on-map <class>
        #   New windows whose class matches <class> are immediately stashed
        #   instead of joining a workspace. Replaces i3's
        #   `for_window [class="X"] move scratchpad`. Recall with `unstash`.
        # stash-on-map FirefoxMarionette

        # === Autostart ===
        # exec strip                                           # the status bar
